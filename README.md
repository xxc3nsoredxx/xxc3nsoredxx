So, you've found my GitHub page.
This can only mean one of two things:

 1. You already know me from somewhere. In that case, you probably got here through a link I shared and are at least somewhat familiar with what interests me.
 2. You've stumbled upon this page from somewhere else. In that case, do check stuff out. If you want. I can't _make you_ do that.

The bio field on the profile is quite short, so finding out I could make a profile README was great.

## tl;dr
Hacking, low level dev, Linux.
That's what I tend to do in my free time.

[`goto end`](README.md#end)

## Education
I've got a BS in Computer Science, and I currently have two semesters of my Master's done.
I'm in my school's Information Assurance track which focuses on cyber security related coursework, and I'm also trying to get the Graduate Level Designation in Cyber Operations.

## Interests and whatnot
My main interests are cyber security, low level development, and Linux.
Bonus points for things that combine two of them together.
If it covers all three, then you've _really_ piqued my interest now!

### Cyber sec
I was fascinated by hackers as a little kid, but it wasn't until 9th grade during my computer science class that I started seriously looking into cyber security.
Writing my own programs was great and all, but I wanted to know if and how I could manipulate already made programs.
I installed Kali Linux onto a flash drive to see what I could do.
Turns out, not very much.
Eventually I found [HackThisSite][hts] and [OverTheWire][otw] and began figuring out what I needed to learn.
A bit after that I started doing CTFs and got decently good at that.
My main focus naturally gravitated towards the binary exploitation and reverse engineering topics.

Early Summer 2020 I got involved with the [Red Team Village][rtv] and planning for DEF CON Safe Mode where my main task was keeping [our Discord server][rtv discord] under control.
At the end of October we held our own virtual conference: [Grayhat][grayhat site].
In addition to keeping an eye on Discord, I managed and coordinated with half of the villages that were presenting during the con and made sure scheduling info was correct and updated it when needed.
Turns out running cons is hard work, but it's also great fun and I've met some great people as a result.

### Low level stuff
I became interested in low level programming &mdash; wait for it &mdash; back in my 9th grade computer science class.
We were learning Java, but it didn't quite scratch the ever growing itch that I had for _truly_ commanding a computer.
I dove down the rabbit hole until I found what seemed to be the bottom: assembly languages.
My naive attempts at learning x86 assembly were quickly interrupted once registers weren't enough and I had to use RAM to store data.
Backtracking a bit to C/C++ helped me understand pointers and memory management allowing me to return to assembly once again.

[ZerOS][zeros] is my long-term OS dev project where I can properly explore this magnificent world.
It's written in pure x86 assembly.
Not because I think I can do better than an optimizing compiler (after all, I'm no [Agner Fog][agner]).
Rather, I just find it to be good fun.
I think I'm on the 4th incarnation now, and comparing my previous attempts gives me an idea of how I've progressed in my overall understanding the inner workings of computers.
Obligatory shoutouts: [OSDev Wiki][osdev wiki] and [the Intel SDM][intel sdm].

### Linux
I've run various different flavors of Linux over the years.
I've never been one for distro hopping and instead try to find one that fits my needs based on research and word of mouth.
If it turns out that it can't do quite what I want out of the box, then I try to find out how I can make it do that.
I started out with Ubuntu on my laptop just before high school, and there's been a Debian based distro running somewhere ever since.
The current ones are Debian stable which powers my VPS and Parrot OS which I use for various levels of prodding things and hoping they break (but in a controlled manner).
For a while, I ran Arch Linux on my Raspberry Pi because Raspbian kept crashing on me.
Then again the 1st gen Model B had a 700 MHz CPU and 512 MiB of RAM, so perhaps asking it to drive an external display while also having a USB keyboard and mouse plugged in was asking a lot.

My main distro of choice these days is Gentoo.
I've ran it on two different laptops for nearly 5 years now I think and plan on sticking with it for the foreseeable future.
Manually configuring the kernel and controlling package compilation with USE flags to include only the features I need fits my DIY aesthetic perfectly.
Unsurprisingly perhaps, a lot of what you can find on here revolves around Linux.
For example, [these random utilities][misc-utils] and [my collection of dotfiles][dotfiles].
