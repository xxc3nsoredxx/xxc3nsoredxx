So, you've found my GitHub page.
This can only mean one of two things:

 1. You already know me from somewhere. In that case, you probably got here through a link I shared and are at least somewhat familiar with what interests me.
 2. You've stumbled upon this page from somewhere else. In that case, do check stuff out. If you want. I can't _make you_ do that.

The bio field on the profile is quite short, so finding out I could make a profile README was great.
Also, I don't have other social media or blog or anything, so why not figure out how to turn my GitHub profile into a poor, hackish version of that?

## Education
I've got a BS in Computer Science, and I currently have two semesters of my Master's done.
I'm in my school's Information Assurance track which focuses on cyber security related coursework, and I'm also trying to get the Graduate Level Designation in Cyber Operations.

## Interests and whatnot
My main interests are cyber security, low level development, and Linux.
Bonus points for things that combine two of them together.
If it covers all three, then you've _really_ piqued my interest now!

I use Gentoo on my laptops because, other than LFS, I don't know of anything that starts you out with as bare of a slate and has you to build up from there.
Even when installing programs you have a very minimal default set of features and have to explicitly instruct Portage to compile in more if you want more.
I absolutely love that.

## too short; want more
[A longer "about me"][about] for people who want more rambling in textual form.
